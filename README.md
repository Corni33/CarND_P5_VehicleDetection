# Vehicle Detection

The goal of this project was to identify vehicles in a video stream, by marking their position with a bounding box.
To achieve this, the following steps were performed:

* Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images
* Color feature extraction (histogram based and via spatial binning)
* Training of a binary classifier
* Implementation of a sliding-window technique to search for vehicles in images
* Design and implementation of a heat map technique to suppress outliers and make the detection of vehicles more robust
* Estimation of a bounding box for detected vehicles

All of the code for completing this project is contained in [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Corni33/CarND_P5_VehicleDetection/blob/master/vehicle_detection.ipynb).
